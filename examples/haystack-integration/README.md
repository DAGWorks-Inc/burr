# Haystack + Burr integration

Haystack is a Python library to build AI pipelines. It assembles `Component` objects into a `Pipeline`, which is a graph of operations. One benefit of Haystack is that it provides many pre-built components to manage documents and interact with LLMs.

This notebook shows how to convert a Haystack `Component` into a Burr `Action` and a `Pipeline` into a `Graph`. This allows you to integrate Haystack with Burr and leverage other Burr and Burr UI features!
