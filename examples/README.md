# Examples

This contains a series of examples. Each example is meant to demonostrate a feature/use-case of the Burr library.

Each example contains:
1. A `README.md` file that explains the example (what its teaching/how it works)
2. A `application.py` file that contains the code for the example. This will have a function `application` that creates the example, and a mainline that demonstrates it.
3. A `requirements.txt` file that contains the dependencies for the example
4. A `notebook.ipynb` file that contains the example in a Jupyter notebook
5. A `statemachine.png` file that contains the graphical representation of the state machine
6. A `__init__.py` file that allows the example to be imported as a module

You can run any example with the following commands:

```python
pip install -r examples/<example>/requirements.txt # use your favorite package manager/venv tool
python examples/<example>/application.py
```
