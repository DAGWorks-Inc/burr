## agent_supervisor

## hierarchical_agent_teams
Example of a multi-agent system where agents are organized in hierarchical teams.
Recursively each team mirrors the `agent_supervisor` example above.

Note: we're working on a better API to express this so you can also see the
entire hierarchy in the diagram.
