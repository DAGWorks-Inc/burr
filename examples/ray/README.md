# Parallelism on Burr

This is supporting code for two blog posts:
1. [Parallel Multi Agent Workflows with Burr](https://blog.dagworks.io/p/93838d1f-52b5-4a72-999f-9cab9733d4fe)
2. [Parallel, Fault-Tolerant Agents with Burr/Ray](https://blog.dagworks.io/p/5baf1077-2490-44bc-afff-fcdafe18e819)

You can find basic code in [application.py](application.py) and run it in [notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb). Read the blog posts to get a sense for the motivation/design behind this.
