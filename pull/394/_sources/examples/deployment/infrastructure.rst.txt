Provisioning Infrastructure/Deploying
-------------------------------------

Burr is not opinionated about the method of deployment/cloud one uses. Any method that can run a python server will work
(AWS, vercel, etc...). Note we aim to have more examples here -- see `this issue <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/burr/issues/390>`_ to track!
