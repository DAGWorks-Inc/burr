Welcome to Burr's documentation, the state machine for managing complex data/LLM projects.

You'll find this documentation separated into three sections.

- If you don't know where to start, go to :ref:`getting started <gettingstarted>`.
- If you're looking to build a mental model/read more, go to :ref:`concepts <concepts>`.
- If you're looking for a specific piece of information, go to :ref:`reference <reference>`.

We also ask that you:

- Report any bugs, issues, or feature requests via `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/burr/issues>`_ or
`GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/burr/discussions>`_.
