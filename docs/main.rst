Welcome to Burr's documentation, the state machine for managing complex data/LLM projects.

You'll find this documentation separated into three sections.

- If you don't know where to start, go to :ref:`getting started <gettingstarted>`.
- If you're looking to build a mental model/read more, go to :ref:`concepts <concepts>`.
- If you're looking for a specific piece of information, go to :ref:`reference <reference>`.

We also ask that you:

- Join the `Hamilton slack <https://join.slack.com/t/hamilton-opensource/shared_invite/zt-1bjs72asx-wcUTgH7q7QX1igiQ5bbdcg>`_ (currently we're combining the help-channel for the two products)
- Give us a star on `GitHub <https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr>`_ if you like the project!
