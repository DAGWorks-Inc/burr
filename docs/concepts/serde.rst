Serialization / Deserialization
================================

Core to :ref:`state-persistence <state-persistence>` is the ability to serialize and deserialize objects.

Burr comes with a pluggable serialization/deserialization mechanism.

There are two approaches: class/type based, & field level registration. See :py:func:`serialize <burr.core.serde.serialize>` and :py:func:`deserialize <burr.core.serde.deserialize>` for reference details.

How it works
------------
The :py:class:`State <burr.core.state.State>` object has a :py:meth:`serialize <burr.core.state.State.serialize>` method that returns a dictionary.
The :py:class:`State <burr.core.state.State>` class also has a :py:meth:`deserialize <burr.core.state.State.deserialize>` method that takes a dictionary and returns a state object.

It is then delegated to persisters and trackers to call these methods and store the serialized state.

Underneath the State object delegates to the :py:func:`serialize <burr.core.serde.serialize>` and :py:func:`deserialize <burr.core.serde.deserialize>` functions.

Customizing Serialization/Deserialization
-----------------------------------------
Here's a video walkthrough of how to add custom type and field serialization/deserialization:

Type based serialization/deserialization
_____________________________________________________
To create your own python type based serialization/deserialization mechanism, you need to implement the following code. The assumption
here is that you have some custom class/type you want to serialize/deserialize.

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Any, Dict
    from burr.core import serde

    class MY_CLASS:
        # your custom class/type
        pass

    @serde.serialize.register(MY_CLASS)
    def serialize_myclass(value: cls, myclass_kwargs: dict = None, **kwargs) -> dict:
        """Serializes the value using my custom methodology.

        :param value: the value to serialize.
        :param myclass_kwargs: not required. Optional.
        :param kwargs:
        :return: dictionary of serde.KEY and value
        """
        if myclass_kwargs is None:
            myclass_kwargs = {}
        return {
            # required to identify how to deserialize
            serde.KEY: "myclass",
            # delegate to your custom serialization
            "value": some_custom_serialization(value, **myclass_kwargs),
        }

    @serde.deserializer.register("myclass")
    def deserialize_myclass(value: dict, myclass_kwargs: dict = None, **kwargs) -> cls:
        """Deserializes the value using my custom methodology.

        :param value: the value to deserialize from.
        :param myclass_kwargs: not required. Optional.
        :param kwargs:
        :return: object of type cls
        """
        if myclass_kwargs is None:
            myclass_kwargs = {}
        # delegate to your custom deserialization
        return some_custom_deserialization(value["value"], **myclass_kwargs)

You'll need to this code to run/be imported so it can register itself.

Field level Serialization/Deserialization
_________________________________________

.. _state-field-serialization:

Field level serialization/deserialization is for when you want to further customize your state serialization
strategy. E.g. you have two fields of the same type but want to serialize things differently.
Registration of this approach is handled by a registration function in the `core.state` module.
When serializing/deserializing state, field names will be first checked to see if there is a
custom serializer/deserializer registered for that field, before delegating to the default
type based serialization/deserialization mechanism.

.. code-block:: python

        from burr.core import state

        def my_field_serializer(value: MyType, **kwargs) -> dict:
            serde_value = _do_something_to_serialize(value)
            return {"value": serde_value}

        def my_field_deserializer(value: dict, **kwargs) -> MyType:
            serde_value = value["value"]
            return _do_something_to_deserialize(serde_value)

        state.register_field_serde("my_field", my_field_serializer, my_field_deserializer)

This will register a custom serializer/deserializer for the field "my_field".

Requirements for the serializer/deserializer functions:

    1. The serializer function needs to return a dictionary.
    2. Both function signatures needs to have a ``**kwargs`` parameter to allow for custom arguments to be passed in. We advise namespacing the kwargs provided to avoid conflicts with other serializers/deserializers.
