Deployment
=======================

This section describes a few ways to deploy your Burr application.

----------------
AWS Lambda
----------------
Burr can be deployed within a Lambda function. This is a good option if you want to run your
application in response to events, or if you want to run your application in a serverless environment.

See `this example <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/burr/tree/main/examples/deployment/aws/lambda>`_ for step
by step instructions on how to deploy a Burr application to AWS Lambda.
