Simulations require state to be maintained across time steps. Burr provides a simple way for you to construct,
manage, and introspect the state of your simulation.

For more information/contribution options, see the placeholder/example sketch in the `repository <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/burr/tree/main/examples/simulation>`_.
