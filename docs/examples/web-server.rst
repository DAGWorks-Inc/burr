Exposing in a Web Server
========================

Burr makes it natural to integrate with a web-server such as FastAPI. See the `example in the repository <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/burr/tree/main/examples/web-server>`_.
for the high-level concepts + some implementation tricks. Run ``burr`` after ``pip install "burr[start]"`` and click ``examples/email-assistant`` to see example in action.
