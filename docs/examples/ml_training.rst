ML Model Training
====================

Hyperparameter Optimization is a key part of training machine learning models. For more sophisticated examples that
aren't grid search, `burr` is a quick and easy way to implement hyperparameter optimization. You want to keep
track of hyperparameters and metrics, feeding these into a decision function to determine where to look next,
and `burr` can help you write and manage that process.

This is still a WIP -- come back soon, or `contribute your own example <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/burr/issues/new>`_!
