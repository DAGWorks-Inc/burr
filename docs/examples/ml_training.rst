ML Model Training
====================

Hyperparameter Optimization is a key part of training machine learning models. For use-cases ranging from grid-search
to gaussian processes, `burr` is a simple way to implement robust, failure-resistant hyperparameter optimization. This involves keeping
track of hyperparameters and metrics and feeding these into a decision function to determine where to look next.
``burr``'s state machine can help you write and manage that process.
