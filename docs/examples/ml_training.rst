ML Model Training
====================

Hyperparameter Optimization is a key part of training machine learning models. For use-cases ranging from grid-search
to gaussian processes, `burr` is a simple way to implement robust, failure-resistant hyperparameter optimization. This involves keeping
track of hyperparameters and metrics and feeding these into a decision function to determine where to look next.
``burr``'s state machine can help you write and manage that process.

For more information/contribution options, see the placeholder/example sketch in the `repository <https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/burr/tree/main/examples/ml-training>`_.
